🧠 **Jugaadu Translator**: Local Phrase Translator
Preserve your roots. Understand each other. One phrase at a time.

Jugaadu Translator is a multilingual, community-powered Streamlit application that helps users translate colloquial and local phrases into standardized Hindi or English. This app bridges India's rich linguistic diversity, one phrase at a time, while collecting culturally significant data that helps build better, more inclusive language models.

🚀 **Features**
🗣️ Colloquial to Standard Translator
Type regional/dialect phrases and get translations in formal Hindi or English.

🔁 Bi-Directional Translation
Translate from standard to local expressions and vice versa.

✍️ User-Contributed Phrases
Let users teach the app new slang, idioms, or regional terms.

🌐 Indic Language Support
Support for transliterated input (e.g., Hinglish), multiple Indian languages.

📤 Corpus Builder Mode
Every phrase contributes to a crowdsourced linguistic dataset. Submitted phrases, their translations, and approximate geolocation metadata (region or state-level) are stored for future training and analysis by implementing google sheets.

⚠️ Privacy Note: All contributions are anonymized. Only the phrase, translation, and region (not exact user location) are stored for research and corpus-building purposes.

🌍 **Problem Statement**
People across India often struggle to communicate across dialects or regions due to highly localized phrases and cultural expressions. At the same time, most modern language models lack exposure to these local speech patterns.

🧩 **Our Solution**
Jugaadu Translator acts as:

A daily-use translation tool for understanding region-specific speech

A data generator for collecting and training regional LLMs

A language preservation utility to document and share disappearing idioms

💡 **Use Cases**

Job seekers translating informal language for formal resumes

Researchers collecting dialectal variation for NLP

Language learners and school children understanding colloquialism
